Ideas:
Deepfake detection as chrome extension
OAuth framework for ease of user

Library for making jackbox-like games on web server.
Research things needed for bare-bones implementation
(Host connect to individual user, are sockets needed? Basic auth to identify answers by each player.
Library creates server but need config file for port and url.  Stick to text but make player response data general.

Difficulty comes from making this scalable, only provide functions for web app communication or have html templates like angular

make in node.js or flask, learn how to make a library, how much has to be accounted for? frontend and backend assuming we provide login/ response components.
